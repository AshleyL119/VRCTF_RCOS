# Simple photo scenario

## Enviroment
<p>A small square room with a desk in the middle of the room. The desk holds a monitor, keyboard, mouse, nameplate, and 5 photos. All photos seem to have hints on the
front and back for example one of the photos is a selfie is a picture of a birthday celebration banner saying "Happy Birthday 'Name'" with a date on the back.
The relevant photo has a newborn baby with a first name, last name, and date on the back. The nameplate has the same last name on this photo</p>

## Task
<p>Login in to the website on the computer. Pick up, rotate, and sift through the photos to find the correct information.</p>

## User Prompt
<p>You need to answer a security question to access an someone's data. The question is:<br> "What is the date the most important day of your life?"<br><br>
Can you figure it out from their office's surroundings?</p>

## Interactibility
- Keyboard:
    - Can be picked up
    - Can be interacted to pull up a keyboard hologram for user input
        - This might be tricky to implement and design.

- Mouse:
    - Can be picked up
- Photos:
    - Can be picked up

## Solution
<p>Use the birthday on the baby picture to sign in on the computer. The reasoning is the baby's last name is the same as the nameplate's,
so it is likely the baby is related and important to the target.</p>

## Notes
<p>Might have to rewrite the story because it doesn't really make any sense. How would you be in that office if you didn't already know the owner's name?
In what situation do you answer a security question without entering the account's name beforehand? It could use some work,
but it might not matter to the educational impact of the exercise.<be>
Still need to flesh out all the photo descriptions, but most of them aren't important.</p>
